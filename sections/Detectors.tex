\section{Detectors}

\subsection{Si352}

Standard silicon pixel detector built at \ac{PSI} using the psi46digv21respin \ac{ROC}. The detector is almost nonirradiated and has just seen radiation during beam tests.

\subsection{3D Diamond Detector - II6-B6}

The detector is made out of \ac{pCVD} diamond, has a thickness of \SI{\sim500}{\micro\meter} and has \SI{50x50}{\micro\meter} 3D pixel cells. In order to match the pixel pitch of the CMS pixel chip (\SI{150x100}{\micro\meter}) \SI{3x2}{cells} were ganged together and connected to the same bump bond.\par
A picture of the final detector is shown in \ar{fig:3d}. Since the diamond detector has only a size of \SI{\sim4x4}{\mm} it is only connected to a part of the bigger \ac{ROC}.
