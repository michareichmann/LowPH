 During the test of new 3D diamond detectors in PSI beam tests using \SI{260}{\mega\electronvolt} positive pions we measured pulse heights far below the trimmed threshold of the ROCs. Both a diamond 3D detector connected via indium bump bonds as well a standard silicon sensor were measured using the psi46digv21respin ROC and showed the same behaviour. The observed behaviour could could not be reproduced using test signals of the ROC electronics.
