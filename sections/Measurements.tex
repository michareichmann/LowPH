\subsection{Setup \& Readout}
\fig{.7}{setup}[ETH Telescope setup with one motherboard and three planes][fig:1]
A demo setup of a ETH Telescope module is shown in \ar{fig:1}. The detectors are glued and wirebonded to a standard carrier-board and then connected to a custom Adaptor-plane via the SAMTEC connector. These Adaptor planes are then plugged into a motherboard which directly connects to the \ac{DTB}.\par
The test boards are operated with the pixel-dtb-firmware dtb\_v4.2 using the pXar-core libraries.

\subsection{Preparation}
Both \acp{ROC} of the diamond detector was trimmed to a threshold of \SI{30}{vcal} and the one of the silicon to \SI{32}{vcal} using the standard trimming algorithm of the pXar GUI in the beam area at ambient temperature without cooling. The pulse-height \acp{DAC} \code{phoffset} and \code{phscal} were then adjusted to achieve linear response of the adc vs vcal in the desired range. The according dacParameter.dat files are shown in \ar{sec:app} (Appendix).

\subsection{Hit Maps}

\subsection{VCAL Distributions}
Using the phCalibration.dat files yields the following vcal distributions.

Even though more dominant in the diamond device both chips show parts of the distribution that are below a the tuned threshold. It even appears as if there is an additional Gaussian contribution around exactly zero vcal. The \acp{MPV} are exactly in the expected positions considering the deposited energies in the detectors.

\subsection{Low Pulse Height Hit Maps}
The position of the hits with a pulse height below the tuned threshold seems more dominant certain pixels but is distributed over the full chip.
